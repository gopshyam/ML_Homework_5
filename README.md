All programs are written using Python 2.7

To run expectation maximization:
$python gmm.py [num_classes]

for example, for 4 classes, run $python gmm.py 4

for epsilon-greedy Q-Learning:
$python agent.py [epsilon]

The command line argument accepted by the program is the numerator over 10, so for an epsilon value of 0.2:
$python agent.py 2

For Boltzmann Exploration:
$python boltzmann.py
